        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-indigo-600">Listing Events:</strong> You can
          list your events on Tesract, providing all necessary details for
          ticket sales and event management.

        <p>
          <strong className="text-indigo-600">Financial Transactions:</strong>{" "}
          All financial transactions are processed through PhonePe. Tesract
          deducts a platform fee and payment gateway fee from each transaction.
          The money collected from ticket sales will be settled to your account
          by PhonePe, typically within 3 to 5 business days (T+3 to T+5 days).
          We do not hold any funds; settlement is handled directly by PhonePe.
